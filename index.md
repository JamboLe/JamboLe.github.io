I’m a rising **senior** at Michigan State University, currently interning at **GreenStone Farm Credit Services** where I’ve been focused on making financial reporting faster and more efficient. By building Power BI dashboards powered by custom SQL queries and using Quarto scripts to automate report generation from raw files, I’ve helped cut down the time it takes to create each report from 1 to 1.5 hours to under 15 minutes, a reduction of over **80%**. It’s been rewarding to see how much smoother and quicker the process has become, especially for reports that used to be manual and repetitive.

Other Projects:

- Creating templates withing databricks that allow for customization of data tables on the cloud

- Multiple Sports Win/Loss Model (work in progress)
