## About Me 

I’m a rising senior at Michigan State University, currently interning at GreenStone Farm Credit Services. I’ve cut report times by over 80% by building Power BI dashboards with SQL and automating reports using Quarto. Some of my hobbies include going to the gym, watching/playing sports, building legos, and spending time with family and friends.
