I will be a **senior** at Michigan State University, currently interning at GreenStone Farm Credit Services. Iâ€™ve cut report times by over **80%** by building Power BI dashboards with SQL and automating reports using Quarto. Some of my hobbies include going to the gym, watching/playing sports, building legos, and spending time with family and friends.
