About Me

I’m a rising **senior** at Michigan State University, currently interning at **GreenStone Farm Credit Services** where I’ve been focused on making financial reporting faster and more efficient. By building Power BI dashboards powered by custom SQL queries and using **Quarto** scripts to automate report generation from raw files, I’ve helped cut report times from 1–1.5 hours to under **15 minutes**  a reduction of over **80%**. It's been rewarding to streamline these processes and help the team save time on reports that were once entirely manual.
